# aides-covid
Replaction of https://github.com/etalab/dashboard-aides-entreprises, with data on Opendatasoft platform.

Currently runs in SPA mode only. SSR should work on Netlify and Now (not Github pages), but Apex doesn't like it for the time being…

## How to deploy
### Vercel
Exemple: https://aides-covid.etienneburdet.now.sh/
Create an account on Now.
Install now CLI
```bash
yarn add global now@latest
```
Deploy
```bash
now
```
In the command prompt, replace `npm run build` by `nuxt generate` as a build command when given the opportunity (you can change that from your dashboard)
### Netlify
Exemple:
* Select your related Github repo from the Netlify dashboard
* Branch: master
* Build folder: `dist`
* Deploy command: `nuxt generate`
### Github pages
Generate the static site in dist folder and push subtree to branch gh-pages:
```bash
yarn generate
git commit -m 'generate static files for deploy'
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```
## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
